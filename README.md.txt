This is a Python implementation of the classic Blackjack card game, where you play against a computer dealer. The project simulates a full Blackjack experience with various features such as card drawing, betting, and player actions. The goal is to replicate the casino experience in a text-based format while keeping it simple and engaging.


Features:


Card Mechanics: The game uses a deck of cards and handles card shuffling, drawing, and player/AI decision-making.


Player Actions: Players can choose to "hit" (draw a card) or "stand" (end their turn). The game checks if the player or dealer has won based on the hand values.


Betting System: Players can place bets and the system checks if the bet exceeds their available balance.


Game Flow: Includes standard Blackjack rules, such as Blackjack, push (tie), and dealer logic for hitting or standing.


AI Logic: The dealer automatically draws cards according to casino rules (stand on 17 or higher).


Player Balance: Tracks the player's balance and updates it based on win/loss, with options to cash out or continue playing.


Custom Quotes: Adds humor and motivational quotes when the player wins, loses, or exits the game.
